I took a break from full-time work and went freelance to allow me the opportunity to explore some of my side projects in more depth. I taught myself Solidity for programming on the Ethereum Network, and I ended up working with some smaller teams and individuals to build games, art projects, and memberships. I mainly worked as a Software Engineer, but still I dipped my toes in design here and there.
