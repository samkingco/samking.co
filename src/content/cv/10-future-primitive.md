I joined FP to work on a new product called [Perma](https://www.per.ma/), a photo sharing app geared towards emulating film photography. I helped launch an initial version of the app in React Native, along with an image processing pipeline using shaders to turn iPhone photos into film-like images. I also built an internal tool to help the team generate new effects and filters for the app using the same shader tech.
