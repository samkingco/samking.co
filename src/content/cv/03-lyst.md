Lyst is a global fashion aggregator, where you can shop over 9 million items in one place. I worked on the web experience where our goal was to make the sheer number of products more discoverable without being overwhelming. This was also the first role where I was able to put some of my software engineering knowledge to use, and I contributed new frontend features on the website, and built internal tools and dashboards for the marketing and sales teams.
