Plain is an API first customer support platform. Plain was partly inspired by learnings from building the customer support tool at LloydsDirect. There weren't any good customer support platforms with really good API's at the time. I joined Plain to help build the early version of the support application used by agents to resolve customer issues. I also worked on a very early version of the Design System for Plain.
