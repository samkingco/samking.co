Deliveroo delivers the food you love, straight to your door. I was part of the Restaurants team building apps and tools to make their experience better on the platform. I worked on products like the app used to accept and manage orders in the restaurant, alongside analytics dashboards and menu management tools. This also meant I worked closely with the Design Infrastructure team to build and maintain the React component library for all internal tools at Deliveroo.
