LloydsDirect is a service that allows NHS patients to get their presciptions delivered to their home without having to go to a physical pharmacy. Initially I worked on warehouse tooling for delivering medicine, but moved to the Patient team to improve the web and mobile apps for patients. We had a huge number of new patients in 2020, so this was a big priority for the business at the time. The goal was to reduce anxiety and streamline the experience. We did this by being more transparent about the process in app, and building a tailored customer service tool to allow our agents to work more efficiently during this period of rapid growth.
