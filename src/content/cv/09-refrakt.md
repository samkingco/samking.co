Refrakt is a platform for photographers to share their work in a more meaningful way beyond the vanity metrics of current social media. The goal is to allow photographers to better connect with each other, inspire, and help each other to make their best work.

Building everything as a solo developer has been challenging at times, but I've learnt so much about what it really takes to architect such systems. I've gone much deeper on backend and infrastructure than I've done before, and now feel like I can build pretty much anything which is awesome.
