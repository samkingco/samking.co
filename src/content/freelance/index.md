## Availability

Taking on very select projects due to limited availability.

I'd love to hear about your idea or what you're building. Send an email to [mail@samking.co](mailto:mail@samking.co) to see how I can work with you.

## What I do

I help early-stage teams turn their ideas into reality. With over 15 years of experience in both design and engineering at startups, I use both my taste and my technical instincts to build things that feel great and work well.

I've worked with teams building creative tools, community platforms, games, and more. Most recently, I've been building [Refrakt](https://refrakt.app)—a photo sharing platform that gives photographers a more intimate and authentic space to connect and share their work.

## How I work

I value intuition over indecision, and curiosity over conformity. My experience allows me to trust my instincts while remaining open to new perspectives.

I take a thoughtful, systematic approach to projects. I'll ask lots of questions upfront to deeply understand your needs, and I'll keep you updated on progress through written updates and video walkthroughs. These are usually 5 to 15 minutes long, where I can show you what I've built and explain my thinking.

While I'm happy to jump on calls when needed, I find I do my best work when I can focus deeply without interruption. This means fewer meetings, but more meaningful updates and clearer documentation. I typically share progress at the end of each day or when a worthwhile milestone is hit, giving you time to review and provide feedback asynchronously.

My schedule isn't the typical 9-5. I prefer to work when I'm most productive, which tends to be afternoons and evenings. Working asynchronously means timezone differences aren't usually an issue, but if you need more real-time collaboration, North American timezones work best.
