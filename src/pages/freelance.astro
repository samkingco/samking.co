  <Definition label="What I do">
    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      I help early-stage teams turn their ideas into reality. With over a
      decade of experience in both design and engineering at startups, I can
      handle everything from initial concepts through to production code. This
      dual expertise means I understand both the user experience and technical
      implementation details, often catching potential issues before they
      become problems.
    </p>

    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      I've worked with teams building creative tools, community platforms,
      games, and more. Most recently, I've been building <Link
        href="https://refrakt.app"
        withIcon={false}
      >Refrakt</Link>&mdash;a photo sharing platform that gives photographers
      a more intimate and authentic space to connect and share their work.
    </p>
  </Definition>

  <Definition label="How I work">
    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      I take a thoughtful, systematic approach to projects. I'll ask lots of
      questions upfront to deeply understand your needs, and I'll keep you
      updated on progress through written updates and video walkthroughs. These
      are usually 5 to 15 minutes long, where I can show you what I've built
      and explain my thinking.
    </p>

    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      While I'm happy to jump on calls when needed, I find I do my best work
      when I can focus deeply without interruption. This means fewer meetings,
      but more meaningful updates and clearer documentation. I typically share
      progress at the end of each day or when a worthwhile milestone is hit,
      giving you time to review and provide feedback asynchronously.
    </p>

    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      My schedule isn't the typical 9-5. I prefer to work when I'm most
      productive, which tends to be afternoons and evenings. Working
      asynchronously means timezone differences aren't usually an issue, but
      if you need more real-time collaboration, North American timezones
      work best.
    </p>

  <Definition label="Pricing">
    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      I offer different ways of working together based on your project needs,
      timeline and company setup.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-1">Project-based</h3>
    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      Best for larger projects or when the scope is more exploratory. We'll
      break the work into clear milestones and agree on deliverables upfront.
      This gives you predictable costs while allowing flexibility in how we
      reach our goals.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-1">Day rate</h3>
    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      Ideal for smaller, well-defined projects or when you need focused help
      for a specific feature or problem. Days are billed as full days.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-1">Retainer</h3>
    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      For ongoing collaboration, usually starting at 3 months. You get a set
      number of days each month, with the flexibility to adjust based on your
      needs. This works well for teams who want consistent access to design
      and development support over a longer period.
    </p>
  </Definition>

  <Definition label="Post-project">
    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      You'll own all deliverables outright. I'll help set up any necessary
      accounts for hosting etc. in your name, ensuring you have complete
      control over your project. This makes it easier if you need to work
      with other people in the future or want to maintain things internally.
    </p>

    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      I'm happy to provide documentation and training to help your team take
      over, or we can discuss ongoing maintenance if you'd prefer that support.
    </p>
  </Definition>

  <Definition label="Let's talk">
    <p class="text-secondary-foreground">
      If this all sounds good to you, I'd love to hear about what you're
      building. Send an email to
      <Link href="mailto:mail@samking.co">mail@samking.co</Link> and we can
      take it from there.
