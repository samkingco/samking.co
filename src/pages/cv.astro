    <h3 class="font-bold">Founder at Refrakt</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Refrakt is a platform for photographers to share their work in a more meaningful way beyond
      the vanity metrics of current social media. The goal is to allow photographers to better
      connect with each other, inspire, and help each other to make their best work.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Building everything as a solo developer has been challenging at times, but I've learnt so much
      about what it really takes to architect such systems. I've gone much deeper on backend and
      infrastructure than I've done before, and now feel like I can build pretty much anything which
      is awesome.

    <h3 class="font-bold">Software Engineer at Future Primitive</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I joined FP to work on a new product called <Link href="https://www.per.ma/" withIcon={false}
        >Perma</Link
      >, a photo sharing app geared towards emulating film photography. I helped launch an initial
      version of the app in React Native, along with an image processing pipeline using shaders to
      turn iPhone photos into film-like images. I also built an internal tool to help the team
      generate new effects and filters for the app using the same shader tech.

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">2022—2024</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold">Freelance Software Engineer and Designer</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I took a break from full-time work and went freelance to allow me the opportunity to explore
      some of my side projects in more depth. I taught myself Solidity for programming on the
      Ethereum Network, and I ended up working with some smaller teams and individuals to build
      games, art projects, and memberships. I mainly worked as a Software Engineer, but still I
      dipped my toes in design here and there.

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">2021—2022</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold">Senior Product Designer at Plain</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Plain is an API first customer support platform. Plain was partly inspired by learnings from
      building the customer support tool at LloydsDirect. There weren't any good customer support
      platforms with really good API's at the time. I joined Plain to help build the early version
      of the support application used by agents to resolve customer issues. I also worked on a very
      early version of the Design System for Plain.

    <h3 class="font-bold">Senior Product Designer at LloydsDirect (formerly Echo)</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      LloydsDirect is a service that allows NHS patients to get their presciptions delivered to
      their home without having to go to a physical pharmacy. Initially I worked on warehouse
      tooling for delivering medicine, but moved to the Patient team to improve the web and mobile
      apps for patients. We had a huge number of new patients in 2020, so this was a big priority
      for the business at the time. The goal was to reduce anxiety and streamline the experience. We
      did this by being more transparent about the process in app, and building a tailored customer
      service tool to allow our agents to work more efficiently during this period of rapid growth.

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">2017—2019</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold">Product Designer at Deliveroo</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Deliveroo delivers the food you love, straight to your door. I was part of the Restaurants
      team building apps and tools to make their experience better on the platform. I worked on
      products like the app used to accept and manage orders in the restaurant, alongside analytics
      dashboards and menu management tools. This also meant I worked closely with the Design
      Infrastructure team to build and maintain the React component library for all internal tools
      at Deliveroo.

    <h3 class="font-bold">Freelance Product Designer at MutualArt</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      MutualArt aims to connect collectors of art with private sellers while also providing in depth
      art market analysis. I came on to help to polish the site after an external agency redesign,
      and introduce some new features like auction analytics and a new artist detail page. I also
      worked on designs for an exhibition finding app on iOS.

    <h3 class="font-bold">Product Designer at Lyst</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Lyst is a global fashion aggregator, where you can shop over 9 million items in one place. I
      worked on the web experience where our goal was to make the sheer number of products more
      discoverable without being overwhelming. This was also the first role where I was able to put
      some of my software engineering knowledge to use, and I contributed new frontend features on
      the website, and built internal tools and dashboards for the marketing and sales teams.

    <h3 class="font-bold">Product Designer at RetailMeNot</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I worked for the UK branch of the money saving website, RetailMeNot. This was my first
      full-time design role where I helped design the in-store coupon experience which was both
      print and mobile. I also worked on various parts of the website, designing seasonal campaigns
      and marketing collateral.

      I co-founded a small photography, design, and software agency. I worked with BMX magazines and
      brands on the photography side, and with local businesses on the design and software side.
