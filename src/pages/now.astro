      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>
        I just moved to Vancouver, Canada. I'm here on a working holiday visa
        for two years with my partner Annesah. We're currently in an Airbnb in
        XÌ±ats'alanexw (Kitsilano) while we look for a more permanent place to
        live. Any recommendations for neighbourhoods to live in would be greatly
        appreciated. Must have good coffee and decent vegan food!
      </p>

      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>
        I don't have a job lined up yet, but I'm looking for a frontend or
        product design role. I'm interested in roles where I can do a bit of
        both, but I'm open to either. I value working with a team that just gets
        on and ships things, so early-stage startups are ideal, or at least
        companies with that kind of culture.

      <h3>Refrakt</h3>
      <p>
        For the last year, I've been working on <Link
          href="https://refrakt.app"
          withIcon={false}
        >
          Refrakt
        </Link>, a platform for photographers to share their work. It combines
        my love of photography, design, and engineering. I'm really enjoying
        learning some software engineering concepts in more depth. It's hard
        work building it all by myself, but it's very rewarding and I can't wait
        to see where it goes.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
      <p>
        Over the summer of 2023, I went on a pottery course back in the UK. I
        loved it! It was so nice making something with my hands instead of a
        keyboard and mouse. Something about being away from a screen was also
        lovely. I haven't done much research yet, but I'd love to do another
        course here in Vancouver. Eventually I'd like to make some small wares
        for myself, and new friends I make here. If you know of any calm studios
        for hire in Vancouver, please let me know!
